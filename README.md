# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe accessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

Accessibility describes the extent to which any user can interact successfully with any given webpage. Development with accessibility in mind is accomplished by ensuring that a web document is usable by as many people as possible, including those that may have disabilities such as visual impairments.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

Websites can be made more accessible with development techniques such as using the most semantic markup possible, allowing users to control and modify the size of fonts and adding keyboard navigation functionality. Additionally, developers can increase accessibility by making effective use of image descriptors and ensuring the website's compatibility with screen-reading software to the greatest extent possible. 

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

Much like in traditional mathematics, variables in programming are used to contain or act as a placeholder for data. Once a variable is associated with some form of data, it can be used in and by other parts of a program to accomplish the developers' goals.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

Functions serve the important purpose of creating a bundled set of repeatable programming instructions in a single place, which allows a developer to make frequent use of those methods without repeating them every time they need to occur within the program. This significantly improves the readability of the the developer's code by preventing the need for repeated or redundant coding elements.

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

Accessing a key within an object which is also within an array can be done by referencing the object's index position within the array and then the key within the object. For example, a key of "name" within an object called "user" at the 0th position in an array called "userArray" might be done using userArray[0].name. This points to the key of "name" within the object of "user" at the 0th index of the array.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and work on the main branch
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. connect to codegrade
5. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
6. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
7. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
